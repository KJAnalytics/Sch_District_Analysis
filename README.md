#  ***School_District_Analysis*** 

##  Project Purpose
Analysis of student Math and Reading test results for a School District utilizing Python, Jupyter notebook, Pandas, NumPy, and OS. During the course of this project, evidence of academic dishonesty and grade alteration were noted for 9th grade student scores in reading and at one of the district high schools.  With this information, the analysis was expanded to include a secondary evaluation with the suspect scores removed. 

##  Project Overview 
Data is provided in two .csv files to be joined, read, cleaned and analyis performed on the joined data. Key performance metrics the following:
  - Top and bottom 5 schools in the district based on overall pass rates.
  - Summarized math and reading scores by grade, school, school type, school size, and school spending levels.
  - Analysis completed on all scores and by "updated" metrics removing altered data for Grade 9 at Thomas
   
## Analysis 
### Objectives:            

Develop a python based program that joins the student and school .csv datasets into dataframes using Pandas, NumPy, and OS as tools for the development of code and configuring the data for analysis as described in the project overview.
